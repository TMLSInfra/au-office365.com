### Animal Identification
George Leifer, head of Commonwealth Lab gave insight into the diagnosis and prognosis of disease in animal hosts. .Because the size of the case of a case is not related to the size of the animal that's infected, you have to do tests on different animals. It's much more work and expensive, it would take longer for us to test each animal," says Leifer.

Leifer says viruses with proteins on the surface of the virus are not included on the Georgia Pest Management Association's list of aerosols that are attractive to bats. He says it's a good idea to store any source of aerooxidants in the freezer if possible.

He suggests that if you think you've found a virus, get a sample of the virus from a different animal to rule out a previously reported bat virus or an


### Medical Devices

Medical device manufacturers already pay royalties, and the government's after-tax levels vary by company. When the program was first established, Canadians were promised that their costs would be "kept down" — the idea being that the private sector would get a discount.

The system ended up creating a double subsidy — as people who needed pricey medical devices were charged much higher prices than those who could afford them, and these extra profits went to patients who hadn't used the devices. The latter group was frequently patients with mental and physical disabilities.
